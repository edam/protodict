# protodict

Is a fork of protobuf-to-dict (created by [Ben Hodgson](http://benhodgson.com/)),
stewarded by [Eugene Van den Bulke](http://github.com/3kwa) as Ben does not appear
to dedicate much time to it anymore.

protodict is a small Python library for 2 ways conversion between dicts
and protocol buffers.

## Installation

Use `pip install protodict` or `python setup.py install`.

## Example

Given the `google.protobuf.message.Message` subclass `MyMessage`:

```python
>>> import protodict
>>> my_message = MyMessage()
>>> # pb_my_message is a protobuf string
>>> my_message.ParseFromString(pb_my_message)
>>> protodict.to_dict(my_message)
{'message': 'Hello'}
```

## Caveats

### Base64 encoded `bytes`

This library grew out of the desire to serialize a protobuf-encoded message to
[JSON](http://json.org/). As JSON has no built-in binary type (all strings in
JSON are Unicode strings), a field whose type is `FieldDescriptor.TYPE_BYTES`
should be converted to a base64-encoded string.

If you want to encode bytes is this way, both `to_dict()` and `to_protobuf()`
take an optional `base64_bytes` argument:

```python
>>> # my_message is a google.protobuf.message.Message instance
>>> my_dict = to_dict(my_message, base64_bytes = True)
>>> to_protobuf(my_dict, base64_bytes = True)
```

### `int` vs. `str` enums

By default, the integer representation is used for enum values. To use their
string labels instead, pass `use_enum_labels=True` into `to_dict`:

```python
>>> to_dict(my_message, use_enum_labels=True)
```

## Unit testing

Tests are under `src/tests/`.

```sh
$ python setup.py nosetests
```

To regenerate `src/tests/sample_pb2.py`:

```sh
$ protoc --python_out=src -Isrc src/tests/sample.proto
```

## Authors

protodict is written and maintained by
[Ben Hodgson](http://benhodgson.com/), with significant contributions from
[Nino Walker](https://github.com/ninowalker),
[Jonathan Klaassen](https://github.com/jaklaassen), and
[Tristram Gr√§bener](http://blog.tristramg.eu/).
[Eugene Van den Bulke](http://github.com/3kwa)'s small contribution started with
a corner case bug fix and an ignored [PR](https://github.com/benhodgson/protobuf-to-dict/pull/5)
which led to this fork.
